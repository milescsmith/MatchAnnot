# Keep track of the best value we're seen so far in a series of calls.

# This is pretty elaborate. But this way we're got all the gubbins in
# one place, and the calls to it in the main body of the program are
# simple. The parent script was starting to fill up with "find the
# best one" clutter.

# One behavioral nuance: If the new candidate's value is *equal* to
# the current best, we *do not* accept it as a new best.
